### what's zimese?
zimese is a language i made for fun. currently it just replaces english characters with zimese's equivalents, but i plan to have custom words sometime soon.

the command line utility can output the syllables of the word (for ease of speaking) as well as the IPA letters corresponding to those sounds. (the "true form" of zimese is written as IPA letters)
